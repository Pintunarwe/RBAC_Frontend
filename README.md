RBAC Dashboard
This project is a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) dashboard built with React, Redux, and integrated with various management features such as user, role, and permission management. It allows administrators to manage roles, users, and permissions efficiently.

Getting Started
These instructions will help you set up the project locally on your machine.

Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

Node.js (>= v14.0.0)
npm (>= v6.0.0)
Install Dependencies
After cloning the repository, run the following command to install all necessary dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

npm start
Runs the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload if you make changes, and you will see any lint errors in the console.

npm test
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

For more information on running tests, check the section about running tests.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include hashes for better caching.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

For deployment information, visit the deployment guide.

npm run eject
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

If you need more control over the build process and configurations (like webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.), you can eject your project. This command will copy all configurations into your project. Itâ€™s not recommended for beginners or small projects, as it removes the simplicity of the create-react-app setup.

Running Tests
To run the tests for the application, simply execute:

bash
Copy code
npm test
This will start the test suite and give you feedback in the terminal.

Project Structure
The project follows the common React structure with a focus on modularity and scalability:

src/ - Contains the main application code
components/ - Reusable UI components (e.g., Navbar, UserManagement, RoleManagement, etc.)
redux/ - Stores and slices for managing application state via Redux
api/ - Mock API calls to simulate fetching roles and users
App.js - Main entry point for the application
Features
User Management: View and manage users in the application, including user roles and statuses.
Role Management: Add, delete, and view roles within the system, along with their respective permissions.
Permission Management: Add and remove permissions for different roles in the application.
Technologies Used
React - JavaScript library for building user interfaces
Redux - For state management and managing the global app state
React Router - To handle routing and navigation between different pages
CSS (or styled-components) - For styling the UI components
Mock API - To simulate server-side data for users and roles
